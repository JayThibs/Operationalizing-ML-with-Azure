# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure

The goal of this project is to explore how we would train a machine learning model in Azure and then put it into production. 

We will start by training, deploying, and consuming a machine learning model in Azure with AutoML. We will do this first part entirely using the AzureML interface and our local command prompt.

In the second part, we will create a pipeline that trains a mahcine learning model and puts it into production using a Jupyter Notebook.

We use a dataset that contains data regarding direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit, based on features such as age, job, marital status, and education. The dataset can be found here: [Bank Marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

Our project will follow the following steps:

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
